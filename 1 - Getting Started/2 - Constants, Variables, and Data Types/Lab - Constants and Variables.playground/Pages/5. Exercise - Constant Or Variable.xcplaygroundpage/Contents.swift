## Exercise - Constant or Variable?
 
 Imagine you're creating a simple photo sharing app. You want to keep track of the following metrics for each post:
- Number of likes: the number of likes that a photo has received
- Number of comments: the number of comments other users have left on the photo
- Year created: The year the post was created
- Month created: The month the post was created represented by a number between 1 and 12
- Day created: The day of the month the post was created
 
 For each of the metrics above, declare either a constant or a variable and assign it a value corresponding to a hypothetical post. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.

// Number of likes can change, so use a variable
var numberOfLikes = 150

// Number of comments can also change, so use a variable
var numberOfComments = 25

// Year created won't change, so use a constant
let yearCreated = 2023

// Month created won't change, so use a constant
let monthCreated = 8 

// Day created won't change, so use a constant
let dayCreated = 15 // Assuming 15th day of the month
