## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

var schooling = 14
print("Years of school completed: \(schooling)")
//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.

print("After completing an additional year, the updated years of school are: \(schooling)")
//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("Variables vs Constants:")
print("Variables, declared using 'var', can have their values updated and changed.")
print("Constants, declared using 'let', are immutable and cannot be changed once set.")
